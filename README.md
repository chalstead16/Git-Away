## introduction

The goal of Git-Away was to create a travel tracker for either personal or corporate use. A traveler can keep track of their travel details and expenses, as well as request new travel from their Git-Away agent.

This was a solo project during Mod 2 of Turing School of Software and Design. The project spec can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/travel-tracker.html).

This project uses Test Driven Development and Object Oriented Programming practices for its design.

## how to run

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone down your new, forked repo
3. `cd` into the repository
4. Run `npm install` in the CLI
5. Run `npm start` in the CLI
6. Open the site by copying and pasting the server location in your URL bar
 - The server location should look something like this -> http://localhost:8080/

## technologies

The technology used to create Git-Away was:

- webpack
- localAPI
- fetch/async
- JSON
- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML
- Mocha & Chai
- VS Code & Atom

## future improvements

Future improvements I would like to add would be a set-time out for the request form. After a few seconds of being idle, the form would reset for a new search. I added three buttons to organize the traveler dashboard, but needed more time to add the logic. And as always, CSS is never complete. I am challenging myself to learn SCSS over intermission, and would like to refactor to include SCSS in future iterations.
